### Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-using-Machine-Learning-and-Deep-Learning-Techniques

This repository contains the files for various machine learning and deep learning algorithms that have been used in our submission for Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Techniques.  
A list of the ML and DL algorithms that have been used are:  
- Multiple Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- K Nearest Neighbours
- Naive Bayes Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- Neural Network Classifier  
The neural network classifier contains a custom loss function, which helps to deal with the dataset imbalance. The dataset is taken from Kaggle, and is also available in the Dataset folder. The citation for the dataset is available at the end of the repository.
